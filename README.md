## ngRedux Example
Example project illustrating how to maintain state (and your sanity) with redux in Angular 1.x projects. Check out the [ng-redux](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ng-redux) project for more information.

## Setup
- ```npm install```
- ```npm start``` for dev server at localhost:3000
- ```npm test``` for unit tests
